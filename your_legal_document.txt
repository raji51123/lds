Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been in existence for many years, and Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) made its appearance over a decade ago [1]. However, its widespread recognition and global usage saw a significant surge in 2022, particularly with the introduction of ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI (see: https://chat.openai.com/). Gen AI tools have proven to be valuable tools especially in the field of education. These tools are capable of producing highly realistic and complex content, can function as an assistive technology, transforming various data types, detecting students' emotional states, and creating adaptive assessments that adapt to student performance, among other potential uses for teaching and learning [2]. Chiu et al, in their systematic literature review [3], identify the main role of AI in Education considering four different categories: (i) Learning: (a) assisting tasks based on individual competence; (b) providing human-machine interactions; (c) analyzing students’ work feedback; (d) increasing adaptability and interactivity in digital environments; (ii) Teaching: (a) providing adaptive teaching strategies; (b) enhancing teachers’ ability to teach; (c) supporting teachers professional development; (iii) Assessment: (a) providing automatic marking; (b) providing students’ performance; (iv) Administration: (a) improving the performance of management platforms; (b) providing convenient and 
personalized services; and (c) supporting educational decision-making with evidence.However, the impact of Gen AI in education comes with both fears (e.g. cheating on exams and ethical 
concerns) and acceptance of change. In Higher Educational contexts, there are diverse opinions among educators, but the trend is to recognize the importance of integrating the teaching of these new technologies into the curriculum, as they will continue to innovate [4]. 
This paper primarily focuses on the integration of Gen AI in ICT engineering education, with a special emphasis on supporting programming skills and ethical considerations of these technologies in ICT engineering education. We aim to elucidate upon a critical observation identified during our comprehensive literature review concerning the application of Gen AI in ICT engineering education. It has become evident that the utilization of Gen AI to bolster programming skills stands out as a more prominent application in this educational context. 
Examples of broader educational scenarios for Gen AI have been identified, which, while not exclusive to ICT engineering, are nonetheless relevant and potentially beneficial across various disciplines. These include for 
example: employing Gen AI as a subject matter expert for inquiry-based learning [5], utilizing it to review and identify errors in AI-generated texts [6], or exploring ethical considerations in AI and academic integrity [7]. In the context of ICT engineering some few examples can be found also regarding the use of these tools to support creativity processes and digital prototyping [8] and teach machine learning concepts [9]. Given the significant emphasis and potential impact of Gen AI in enhancing software engineering tasks specifically, we have chosen to highlight its role in this area as a focal point of our discussion. Also due to its implications in teaching/learning we discuss the ethical considerations of AI in engineering educational settings. This approach allows us to delve deeper into the practical applications and implications of Gen AI in nurturing advanced programming competencies,
